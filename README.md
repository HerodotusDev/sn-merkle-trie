# SN Merkle Tree

Minimal implelementation of a Merkle Tree used in StarkNet.

Heavily rely on [pathfinder's merkle tree implementation](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/tree/9e0ceec2c56a88ed58b6e49ee7ca6bccd703af33/crates/merkle-tree), but target to make it easy port as external dependency.

- [ ] transaction and receipt trie generation and get proof/verify
- [ ] sync with type from [type-rs](https://github.com/starknet-io/types-rs)
